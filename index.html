    <p>Why use a truck you ask? Many people do not have much time in the mornings to cook or even stop somewhere for breakfast in today's busy times. We think that bringing the food to you helps alleviate those issues. You can be sure we will show up at the scheduled time and provide fresh coffee and food to get you started right. </p>
    <p>So how is the truck equipped? We have a mobile breakfast machine here. Inside the truck we have toasters, a large griddle, coffee makers, a stove, and even a waffle maker.  The truck is state of the art when it comes to bringing you breakfast. It's a well-maintained newer model so you can rest assured it will be there every day. We also pride ourselves in cleanliness so the food is prepped and cooked in a sanitary manner. </p>
